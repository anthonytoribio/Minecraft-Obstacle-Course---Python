# Minecraft-Obstacle-Course---Python
An obstacle course rendered by running a python script. Utilizes the MCPI library.

The code is made up of two classes the Decoration class and the MC class. The Decoration class holds methods that allow the user to create 3D graphics onto the Minecraft world. Specifically, it contains methods: create_tornado and create_tie which creates a tornado and a Star Wars tie-fighter respectively. The MC class has a number of methods that are responsible for creating a specific part of the obstacle course. The main method that a user should use is the 'run' method which puts these parts together to make a relatively random obstacle course each time the 'run' method is ran.
